# orcid_model

This repository contains a sample model representing a proposal object that could be pushed to a users ORCID record
via the v3.0 api. Included is a sample (OrcidJsonDocTest.java) that gives a simple example of how this model 
could be populated and generates a valid Json document for pushing to ORCID.
